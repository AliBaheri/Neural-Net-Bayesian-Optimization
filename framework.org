* TODO
** Convert from uniform sampling to uniform random sampling
** Implement Gaussian?
** Implement multiple point selection
** Implement exploration v. exploitation (if EI is all negative, use pure exploration). 
** Updating the NN?
   It seems that updating the NN's dataset is a bad idea. I wonder why...
   It is currently NOT updating the NN's dataset, but retraining based on
   a different architecture...?
   Things that work:
   comment out optimizer.train(), but update NN dataset.
   run optimizer.train(), but do not update NN dataset
